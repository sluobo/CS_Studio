Mot_Descr
I wanted to start running and needed a way to carry my phone. Also they were cute.

My mom was going to get rid of it and I thought it would fit well with my current wardrobe and style

Because it didn't fit my friend but it fit me.
"It is kind of a funny story, my softball coach said the best way to deal with sadness( losing our season due to COVID-19) is retail therapy (she was kind of kidding). So when I got home I decided I was going to buy new, cute clothes for summer in order to feel better. I bought the blouse in order to dress cute during summer and as a fitness goal I suppose."
I purchased a new pair of pants to have more options to wear throughout the week.
It was for a friends sorority formal. I don't have formal wear and am taller than all my friends so I couldn't borrow anything.
"My roommate wanted to go shopping and I happened to find this skirt that I liked, it wasn't very expensive so I bought it."

I got the clothing item because I though it was cute and a lot of my other sweatshirts had stains on them or were worn out.
"My mother got it for me since she knows that Eugene is a cold place and a winter jacket would help during next school year. She got me a jacket previously but it just didn't fit right so we returned it and this was the replacement. By the way, we come from California where it is much warmer."
I thought it would look good on me

I got it because i needed a longsleeve top
I wanted something comfortable to sleep in.
"I thought it looked nice on foreign celebrities and I wanted to copy their style. I felt like I can add my own twist on the jacket and change certain parts of it as well. In all, I thought wearing it would be different from what my friends would wear but still similar enough to not be looked at weirdly."
It was on the sale rack at Zumiez so it was cheap. Also it's an XL and I wanted a baggier tshirt cause I didn't really have any beforehand.
"I got it because I really liked how it looked on me and didn't have many sweaters that I felt comfortable in both mentally and physically. It was in a really pretty color. I also got it because it can also be considered business casual, which was good because I was shadowing physician assistants at the time and needed business casual items because I did not have any."
"I just wanted it if I am being honest. I just got it today actually but haven't had a chance to wear it yet due to the COVID-19 virus, but I still just decided to buy it for when I go out when the quarantine is over. So, in short, I mostly just buy clothes because I like them or want them. I thought the fur coat was cute and have been wanting one for awhile now."

I needed a winter jacket and so I could stay warm.
"I needed some boot cut jeans that I could wear for occasions where I didn't want stained ones. I am also pretty skinny, so finding pants that fit me decently and also go over boots can be difficult. I tried these ones on and they fit very well."
I got it because I like the fit of the pants generally and they're kind of hideous and beautiful at the same time and very similar to my personality of making a fool of myself
"I was going out with my friends and I did not have many cute, going out clothes."
"I wanted a jean jacket that I could layer over dresses and jumpsuits. Its good for springtime and summer when its warm, but can still get chilly."

Gift
Because it looked cool and I got it without paying money for it.
"I got this clothing item because I knew it would allow me to expand my look and personal brand.

"I originally went to Spencer's because I had a free shirt I could get based off of a punch card I had. When I got to the store I just looked around and had a few choices I was considering to get, but choice that one. The shirt I left with I liked the design the most and wanted to add darker colors since I have a colorful wardrobe. Majority of my clothes are over sized since I find it comfy."
I got it because I like the style of skirt it was and I thought the print was unique and unlike something I already had. I thought I could style it in a fun way and it would look cool.
I have wanted a dress like that for weeks and it was on sale. I know that I will eventually wear it with friends and to events. I also really like buying things and I have't bought clothes or makeup for a couple months so it was a matter of time before I bought something

"I have always liked Marilyn Monroe. I have had posters of her on my wall since I was a kid. So naturally when I saw the socks with her on them, I had to get them."

I got the shoes to work out in and have a practical and cute shoe to also wear in my daily life. They double as workout shoes and everyday shoes. I had my old workout shoes since 8th grade and I am now a junior in college. They are more comfortable and more my style. I need good shoes to workout in and go to the rec in.

I did not have another one like it already. It made me happy and brought me joy and it was really comfortable. I feel guilty now because the more I think about how harmful fast fashion is, the less I think I should have bought it."
"It was a cool Oregon jacket and I wanted some more school spirit clothing, it was also before winter"

"I saw a dude at the gym wearing them and I really liked the low profile, stylish look that they had. I asked him what they were and he said Adidas Ultraboosts. I waited for a while until they went on sale and then decided they were worth the money. I've seen them a couple of times before and they look great and expensive so I bought them to fit in better at the school"

"I got the jacket because I've seen so many amazing denim jackets people have made with patches and pins on them and they always impress me so much. I wanted one of my own so I could have something of my own like that. Also, jackets like that always strike me as incredibly gay and as a bi-ish nonbinary person looking vaguely gay at any point in time is high on my list of fashion priorities."

It is the liquid.
I got the binder in an effort to reduce my gender dysphoria I have been recently experiencing. As the weather gets warmer I can no longer wear many layers to hide the shape of my chest.

"I was looking for a new summer dress because I recently donated a bunch of old clothes and I wear more dresses and skirts when the weather gets warm. I also picked this dress because I have recently started wearing more yellow. I had a close friend for a long time that would always tell me that I looked bad, especially in yellow, and I am not friends with this person anymore so it feels good to wear yellow clothes as other people always compliment me about how I look good in yellow. All my clothes I pick because I feel they express a part of who I am."
"They were cheap and affordable, as well as fashionable! Although I was not in dire need of more leggings, I was excited t recycle clothing at a great cost!"

"I was looking for something breezy for summer, and also I felt bored because I hadn't bought anything new in a while. I know that it is wasteful to just buy clothes because you are feeling bored of your old ones, but I try and usually combat this by donating or selling my old clothes if they are not damaged and buying from primarily recycled fashion stores. Still, it is financially wasteful and makes me feel bad for not saving money."
I got this clothing item because it was on sale and I had just enough money to buy it and I had been wanting to buy something like it for a long time.

"I got the leggings because they are good for the current quarantine circumstance. I also wear this style of leggings when I am going to work out, so buying them seemed practical.

my tits were spilling out of my old bikini top so that's why I needed a new one!!!

"It was simple, clean, and appealing."
I saw it listed when searching for a different kind of top and liked the color and fabric. I wanted a green top to go with a pair of green pants I also purchased recently. It was definitely unnecessary but I've been on a bit of a shopping spree since downloading the Depop app a few weeks ago (yikes!).  The top was a bit more 'mainstream' than I'd usually buy but I thought the color was unusual and fun. It was also reasonably priced.

I love green and I also really like button-downs! I mostly wear clothing like that to work and class. It was also on sale :)
"I didn't have a pair of slacks but I also didn't like the he standard, tight-fitting ones that seem to be popular because I don't think it looks flattering on me. Besides, these are really comfortable and versatile (looks fine with blouse or tee-shirt)."
"This shirt is so cute and gives me 80s/90s vibes because of the style of the cartoon and the shade of green the shirt itself is and I have fallen in deep love with the fashion aesthetic of the 80s and 90s. Green is also one of my favorite colors and cats are one of my favorite things in the world and they were each complimented by each other in this shirt, and because it was only $5 and second-hand I was very much up for purchasing it."
Needed it for a friends sorority formal. I don't have formal wear and am too tall to borrow from friends.
"I got the jacket because I didn't have one and being from Southern California, I don't really have any heavy duty rain jacket because the weather doesn't really call for one. I was often told that winters in Oregon were cold, rained a lot, and sometime snowed so I needed to prepare for that since my closet didn't really account for those weather conditions."
I asked my mom for the shoes and she bought them for me. The shoes were not purchased out of need.

I found a pair in pacsun that fit good enough so I bought them.
"It was a gift from my sister to celebrate getting accepted to the U of O. She gave me a U of O shirt.
I feel like it's hard to answer this survey using a gift as an example. To get at some of the ideas you're asking about. I don't generally buy Nike brand and I don't generally buy clothing with writing on it because I'm not a billboard and I don't want to use my body to promote brands or ideas. I will wear logos for organizations I volunteer with. I don't buy a lot of clothes because I don't want to spend money on clothes and because it's terrible for the environment although I'm not very responsible when I do purchase clothes I will often choose cheap over responsibly source. I try to make up for it buy wearing them until they are literally falling apart. All that said, if my sister hadn't given me a U of O shirt I probably would have bought one myself because supporting the local sports team is a quick way a signalling that you're part of the in-group. I move often and I always support the local team because it's a short cut to social inclusion."
I started to work out a lot recently and I had 2 pairs of leggings that I had to keep washing. I got a new pair to limit the amount of laundry I kept doing.

I like them they are comfortable
"I needed new leggings for working out. Also, I saw someone at the gym wearing the same pair and she gave me a great recommendation."
I have a very gothic style that is unconventional. I like wearing clothes that throw people off and make them question me a bit. I am a firm believer in don't judge a book by its cover. I often become friends with non-judgmental and open-minded individuals as a result of how I dress.

"The shorts looked cute and comfy. I like to feel cute when I'm comfy, even if I'm alone in my house."
"I needed new shoes as I wear the same pair until they are beat. They were a bit of a splurge, but my mom wanted to gift me something nice for my birthday and it is what I had my eye on for about a year."
"I usually have very specific or exact models for the items I want. I always look for clothing items that are stylish, suits my style; uses good materials that can last for a long time; they seem like basic items but the details make it looks better on me; worth the price."

I just liked the way it looked and it was on sale so I thought it might be cute to save as a summer shirt.
"I just really liked the design on the shirt first of all. And the fact that I know it would fit me in the style I preferred made me more likely to buy it. Starting to think of it, I guess I also just knew it would fit my aesthetic more. A lot of people tell me I have a ""skater"" aesthetic and they do have a point I guess. I cuff my pants sometimes and wear vans and I like loose fitting shirts. So I guess this shirt was just my style."

"I needed a jacket that was heavier than just a windbreaker but lighter than the winter coat I had. Puff jackets are (or were last winter) pretty popular.

No anything.
Because it looked like a top that I would wear often and I think enjoy wearing it.

I thought it looked nice and figured I deserve to buy myself something since I rarely do get new clothes.
"I got this item of clothing because I wanted it. I had the money to buy it, so I placed a bid on the dress. I also thought that I would like the way I looked in the dress.

I thought this was a really cute look similar to what I've seen some friends wear and I have been interested in wearing more pastel colors, so I looked around for a few days until I found a similar turtleneck at a reasonable price and ordered it. I already wear a lot of turtlenecks, so I probably didn't need another one, but I figured I'll wear it underneath some of my summer tops in the winter."
